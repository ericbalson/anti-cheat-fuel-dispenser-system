# anti-cheat-fuel-dispenser-system
Fraud by attendants at fuel stations is one of the many forms of theft in this country. Our project, which was an anti-cheat system for fuel dispensers, was aimed at curbing this. In this system, the customer enters the amount of money he/she wishes to pay for the fuel into a portable electronic device he finds at the fuel station. The data about the amount paid by the customer is relayed to the dispenser wirelessly, hence preventing the attendant from entering a false amount into it and cheating the customer.
